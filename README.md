## Synopsis
This project analyzes storms and severe weather events data from NOAA (U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) database collected during 1950 to 2011. There is nearly a million records of data with around a thousand types of events. Statistics for Fatalities, Injuries, Property Damage, and Crop Damage have been aggregated by event type, resulting in a dataset of around thousand records. Since we are interested in the most harmful event types, I selected the top 10 most harmful event types (by Fatalities, Injuries, and asset damage) for more detailed analysis. I found that Tornado event type caused most Fatalities and Injuries. Plots are included to show this. Wind and Tornado event types caused the most asset damage (combining Property and Crop damages). Plots to show this are also included. Top fwew event types causing significant damage and harm were Tornado, Wind, Heat, Flood, Hail, and Lightning. 
Rmd file is attached showing descriptions, code, and results.
